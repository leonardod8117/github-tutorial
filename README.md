## Git vs. GitHub
###Git
* Git has "version control", which means it manages multiple versions of a file   
  by allowing you to take "snapshots" of code.  

* Also, Git does not require Github.  

###Github 
* Github requires Git because it serves to store code generated in Git in the cloud.

* It visually tracks changes so when ever changes are made in a file you can view those  
  changes in Github.  

* Files in Github are easily collaborated because they are public so anyone can view them  
  and suggest or make changes to them.

## Initial Setup
* To begin using Git and Github you should start by creating a Github account.  
 * Go to [Github.com](github.com) and sign up for free.  

* After signing up for Github you need to link your Github account with your Intergrated  
  Development Environment or **IDE** from the platform you are using.  
    * In github, click on your account icon in the top right hand corner.
    * Go to settings and click on _SSH Keys_ then go to the platform the **IDE** is on   
    and go to settings.   
    * Obtain the _SSH key_ in the settings and copy it.
    * Then return to github, click on add _SSH key_ and paste.  

* After connecting your Github account and your IDE, you should open your IDE and see  
 the following: `ssh -T git@github.com(yes/no)`  
 * Type in yes and you have successfully connected your IDE with your Github.
