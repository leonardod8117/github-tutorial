When you enter these commands individually, they should look like this:  \r\n * `git config --global user.name \"Leonardo De La Rosa\"`  \r\n    `git config --global user.email \"anderosa8@gmail.com\"` \r\n   \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\n* To begin using Git you must do the following:  \r\n * Go to your directory(folder) of files.  \r\n * Intialize Git using the command `git init`, which gives you version control  \r\nand creates a repository(where files are kept and changes are tracked).\r\n\r\n* After you have created a file in a repository and have made changes, you  \r\nshould save it by doing the following:  \r\n * In the repository the file is located, type in the command  \r\n`git add {name of file}` to add the file in the repository to the stage.  \r\n * Then type in the command `git commit -m \"\"` and write a message  \r\nbetween the quotes about the changes you have made in the file. \r\n\r\n* In order to see the repository and the files within it on Github you should do the following:  \r\n * you must go to Github and click on the plus icon in the top-right hand corner and click on new repository.\r\n * In the space provided, type the name of your repository in git and then click create repository. \r\n\r\n* You will then be brought to a page where you are given instructions on how to setup a  \r\nconnection between the external repository(remote) in Github with the one in Git and  \r\nyou are provided with an SSH link to the repository.To make the connection you should  \r\ncopy and paste these two commands in git:  \r\n * `git remote add origin SSH link here`  and  `git push -u origin master`.  \r\n\r\n* After doing the previous step, you should refresh your page and be able to see the changes you made in your repository on Github.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n### Basic Workflow  \r\n* Whenever you make any changes to a file in a repository on git, you should:  \r\n *  Use the command `git add file name` to put the file on the stage.\r\n *  Then type in the command `git status` to see if the file you made  \r\n    changes to is on the stage.  \r\n * Type the command `git commit -m \"\"` and write a message regarding   \r\n   the changes you have made in the file.  \r\n * Type in the command `git push` (Note: you do not have to type in  \r\n`-u origin master` because when you did so the first time, you were  \r\ncommanding Git to remember the remote you entered previously).  \r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n* The Git commands you should know are as follows:\r\n  1. `git init`: initializes git in the directory you are currently in.  \r\n  \r\n  2. `git add file.ext`: adds file to stage to be committed. \r\n \r\n  3. `git commit -m \"short-specific message\"`: takes a 'snapshot' of files  \r\n      on the stage. The message should be short and describe what changes\r\n      were made to the file.  \r\n  4. `git status`: tells you which files were placed on the stage.(It will be green) \r\n  \r\n  5. `git remote add origin SSH link here`: This creates a connection between a  \r\nrepository in git and an external repository in Github.  \r\n  6. `git push`: sends any changes made in a repository in Git to an external repository you made in Github.  \r\n  \r\n  7. `git help`: this will list commonly used commands in git.  \r\n  \r\n  8. `git log`: use this to see a list of all your past commits. \r\n  \r\n  9. `git diff`: shows you the difference between your current code and the last 'snapshot' of your code.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n## Error Handling  \r\n* If you intialized Git in the wrong directory, don't fear and follow the directions listed here:  \r\n  * Go to the directory you intialized git in and type in `rm -rf .git` and press  \r\nenter.This should \"un-init\" git so you can initialize git in the correct directory.  \r\n\r\n* To remove a repository in Git you should:  \r\n *  Be in the directory that the repository is located in.\r\n *  In this directory, type in the command \"rm -rf name of repo\" to remove the repo forcefully.  \r\n \r\n* To remove a repository in Github you should:  \r\n  * Go to the repository's main page on Github. \r\n  * In the repository's sidebar on the right side, click on settings.\r\n  * Scroll down to **Danger Zone** and click on _Delete this repository_. \r\n  * Read the warning, type in the name of the repo, and click **I understand the consequences,delete this repository**.  \r\n\r\n### Forking & Cloning    \r\n* If you were to accidentally delete a repo in git, you can take a copy of  \r\nit from GitHub with cloning by:  \r\n * Going to the main page of the repo in Github.\r\n * Look for the SSH clone URL below the right side bar and copy it. \r\n * Return to git and type in the command `git clone SSH clone URL` in the  \r\ndirectory you want to place the repo in.  \r\n\r\n* If you want to use someone else's work as the foundation for your work, you can use forking by:  \r\n  * Going to the main page of the repo that you want to use as a starting point  \r\nand click on fork at the top-right of the page. By forking this repo, you are  \r\nmaking a personal copy of it that you can make changes to.  \r\n  * After forking the repo, go to the main page of your personal copy of the repo  \r\nand copy the SSH clone URL below the right sidebar.  \r\n  * Go to git and type in the command `git clone SSH clone url here` and you now have the forked repo in git.  \r\n\r\n* If you wish to offer the changes you made in your personal copy of the forked repo  \r\nto the owner of the original repo, you must:  \r\n  * Go to the main page of your forked copy of the repo in Github. \r\n  * Click the green button in the top left of the page, next to the branch button. \r\n  * A new page will open and you will see a button that reads \"create pull request\". Click the green button. \r\n  * You are given the option to write a comment and once you are done, click \"create pull request\" below the text box. \r\n\r\n  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
